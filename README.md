# Diabetes Prediction with PIAM: From Traditional ML to Advanced Approaches

This repository contains the complete code for our project on diabetes prediction using the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset. The project explores a range of models, from traditional machine learning approaches to advanced deep learning techniques. In particular, the repository includes implementations of:

- **Previous Model** (baseline traditional ML models)
- **Previous Model with Data Processing**
- **LSTM Model**
- **LSTM-AR Model** (LSTM with Artificial Records)
- **2D-CNN Model**
- **2D-CNN-AR Model** (Hybrid model combining 2D-CNN and Artificial Records)
